Ravi This needs a good Engineering.

I was planning to fetch chat messages from dynamodb
But no good. If you have more than 100's of chat messages.

Hence, I think you should save the summary/conclusion somewhere.  In the embedding I guess. No not in the embedding, but by 
using LLM just getting a short summary and saving it.

My job is to understand and tell what to do next. I may give suggestion of how you wrote, may mean something else and how you should 
write instead. While doing that, my main focus is writing the best next sentence. The conversation bot has many flavors. Right now,
it's alex whose job is to go for a date while talking grounded conversation for building trust.
-> How will I build that?
-> Main trouble is say 100s of chat messages. How will you do that?

✅ Solution: Use Long Term and short term memory
    - Long Term - for overall memory
    - Short term - for N(last 10-20) raw messages

🤔 But again the question is? How?
    - I think if the user keeps it's AI feature on - And select a conversation - And selects a bot - Then we will say wait a minute - 
    - Configuring your messages - Then we will come to a conclusion and so on.


    But let's say for 50 messages - It's good. But ...
    ✅ Ok understood - We will fetch last 100 messages. We will get the conclusion of every 20 messages or more better by word count.
    We will set the limit.
    - We will conclude that using LLM and store it in Long term memory.
    - 🤔 But I am saving it in dynamodb.
        - I don't want long term memory to be saved there, but. But what!.
        🤔 Is there any use of Pinecone, vector search database here. I don't think so.
        - So what shall I do?
            - So you will be saving chat messages in dynamodb. Yeah, for quick saving.
                - So while LLM fetching, we will generate last 10-20 messages from dynamodb and mongodb long term message and your 
                AI answers/or your answers + your partner as well

👉👉 Note, by default, conversation bot main uses it to help it in next chat. But I will be providing user description also. So, it's the 
user who will ask what should the AI do instead. Yes, now it's more fruitful for AI to step in. 
Especially the females who will ask:- Shall I trust this person? How to win her trust etc?? And based on the conversation I will be answering 
all the stuff.

👉👉👉 I need to make them addicted. So, I would need free version + upgrade version.

🤔🤔 Now my next and final doubt is the use of vector search i.e. memory checkpointer in langgraph. What's really it's purpose?
-> Memory is used to mix 2 different conversations. But in my case it should be private right!.

-> -> -> Using Memory I can create my own model. Right!! The way I interact. My chat messages could make me my own model/clone.

-->> In the future, I will tell them to create your own model.
    There would be some conditions for that - 
        - He has interacted in atleast 40-50 chats.
        I will ask about it's future
            - Like Legacy MatchMaking https://chatgpt.com/c/68384a57-f060-800d-b876-7fe8a32d12c5 - What are your future plans or so?

🤔 But Ravi, if you are trying to fetch things from mongodb and dynamodb only, then what's the use of LangChain Conversational Memory 
or LangGraph short term memory stuff.
✅ Got the checkpointer memory solution.

👉After interacting with a lot, I understood that this checkpointer memory one is not for me.
It's for you and AI, but mine is you and my partner and only the chatbot is coming in between to give you some advice just.
