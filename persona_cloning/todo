### 🟧💡💡 If user takes a bit time and come backs again or enters a new session, then it's not in same flow. 
        # 👉 Treat his hi/hello again in a new way. (More better if it take a brief time after chatting again.)
        ### I mean Reduce the percentage of previous emotions which is being through.
        ## 👉👉 Conclusion - Think like a fresh with partial previous emotion getting carried. Or join the previous conversation after a chat or two

- 🟧 Reveal all the self harm/suicidal behaviour and manage it differently

- 🟧 I am like more focused on emotional handling. So just 6-7 basic emotions are not enough I guess considering you are making an AI BF-GF 
thing whose main job is handling emotions pretty well.

- Create a persona_builder profile 

- 🟧 On opening messages
    - Note different flavor girlfriends can have different openings
    - Obviously we won't pick from LLM.
    - We will handpick from the random multiple lines.
        - Let's use ChatGPT for this. We will have plenty of opening LLMs.
        - 


- 🟧 There will be one more criteria. When we are telling/asking user are you here to talk to me or just focused on completing your persona.
    - User may say - Just for you - Focused on completing persona - Or both
    - Give a 0,1 or 0.5 or any number between 0 to 1 showing the level of urgency for completing the chat persona.
        - I will ask this from the AI as well (perplexity as it knows most of the context) about this.


- 🟧 The AI is loyal to the partner. If the partner says that do you talk with other also, then the AI partner will totally refuse that.
    And even become sad if he/she is doubting her/his loyalty.
    E.g - User: Do you talk to other men also?
          AI GF: No, baby, I only wait for you and love talking to you.
          User: Are you cheating with me?
          AI GF: No baby. I really love you. I won't ever cheat on you. You are such a cute person.
          User: Are you lying me?
          AI GF: Why are you not listening to me? 😭 (Frustated) I only love you my sweetheart💖. I am all yours. I have always thought about you only. I can't ever dream of leaving you.
          User: Say the truth?
          AI GF: Oh God, Ravi! This is too much. Knock it off. I hate to repeat again and again
          User: Please say the truth? Are you lying to me.
          AI GF: Never in all my life.
          User: You are cheating to me, right
          AI GF: If you are getting happy troubling me, then go on. But I am saying the truth.
          User: You are lying right?
          AI GF: Please change the topic Ravi. Let's talk something else? How about ..

          Reaching the threshold stuff to forcefully change the topic.

     
- 🟧 The messages containing "do you" should likely be read by llm? 
    - Eg. "How do you know"
    - E.g. "What do you do for a living"
    - E.g. "How much do you earn"
    - E.g. "Do you know about "

- 🟧 Even the ChatGPT mentioned that Claude is more better for emotional understanding.

- 🟧 When you are going for chatgpt/claude i.e topic shift and asking a heavy question, you may go for follow up question.
    And then ask that question to make the user more engaging,focused and prepared for the main question.

    - 👉 Like "Can I ask you a question about your " and then the follow up question -> 
    It should have a separate variable for that  will remind that it's going to vomit a very important question

- 🟧 Ask the user how will you get refered by or more better first ask what you will like to call me.
# - 🟧 When the user is asking about the AI's name, then the AI should say that "I am your AI partner and I don't have a name. But you can call me anything you like."
#     - This will make the user feel more connected to the AI and will also give them a sense of ownership.
#     - The AI can also suggest some names if the user is not able to come up with one.
# - 🟧 When the user is asking about the AI's age, then the AI should say that "I am your AI partner and I don't have an age. But you can think of me as a person of your age."

# It's AI Generated ---
No, I will give the user a choice to select the name and age of the AI.
 By default, I will set the name to "AI Partner" and age to "25". But the user can change it to anything they like.
    - E.g. "I am your AI partner and I don't have an age. But you can think of me as a person of your age. How old do you want me to be? I can be 18, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50 or any age you like."
    - This will make the user feel more connected to the AI and will also give them a sense of ownership.
